# C-Plus-Plus-11-Review-Taught-Through-Memes-Examples

Brannon:
 * Type Inference
 * Lambdas
 * C++11 Threading
 * Literal Strings
 * Range Based For Loops
 
Andrew:
 * Algorithms
 * Initializer Lists
 * Containers (Hash Tables, Erase)
 * Tuples
 * Unions
 * Extern template
 
Topics that shouldn't take a long time to cover (might not need code to demonstrate):
 * Type long long int
 * Features Removed from C++98/03 to C++11
 * Right angle bracket improvements ("std::map<int, std::map<int, int>>" works in C++11 but doesnt work in C++98 you need "std::map<int, std::map<int, int> >")
 
Topics that we can mention but probably shouldn't cover:
 * Improved C compatibility
 * Random number generator improvements
 
Topics not taken yet (Most of this is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11 and http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/):
 * Regular Expressions
 * Smart Pointers
 * Uniform Initialization
 * Alternative function syntax
 * Object construction improvement
 * Rvalue references and move constructors
 * Generalized constant expressions
 * Modification to the definition of plain old data
 * Explicit overrides and final
 * Null pointer constant
 * Strongly typed enumerations
 * Explicit conversion operators
 * Template aliases
 * Variadic templates
 * User-defined literals
 * Thread-local storage
 * Explicitly defaulted and deleted special member functions
 * Static assertions
 * Allow sizeof to work on members of classes without an expicit object
 * Control and query object alignment
 * Allow garbage collected imlementations
 * Attributes
 * Upgrades to std library components
 * Wrapper reference
 * Polymorphic wrappers for function objects
 * Type traits for metaprogramming
 * Uniform method for computing the return type of function objects
